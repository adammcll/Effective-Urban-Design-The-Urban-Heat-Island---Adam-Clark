METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

Description of methods used for collection/generation of data - Methods for processing the data:

Extensive individual research exploration through City of Calgary open data sets and peer reviewed reports from accredited publishing groups. For exact mathematics into my indicator I utilized the City of Calgary. (n.d.). Community Profiles. Retrieved from https://www.calgary.ca/communities/profiles.html and ran the community profiles through the latest advanced version of ChatGPT 4.0. This AI software allowed me to extract exact parcels of data from each community profile page and generate a compiled dataset containing: Home age, New homes built, Number of homes per community, Amount of relative income per community, as well as community tags which allowed me to further categorize each data entry. This resulting dataset served as the benchmark for the creation of my two complimentary metrics. By also utilizing the information contained within the newly legislated Calgary Land Use Bylaw: 1P2007. City of Calgary. 2024. I was further able to add tangible numerical values to my formulae as the bylaw outlines 3 trees per new home planted. By analyzing the construction date, home materials used, amount of existing canopy (through research/Bylaw 1P2007) I concluded that tree canopy contribution per one individual tree is approximately 10 meters squared. By further applying my knowledge of the 3-30-300 rule I was able to conclude the relative scoring metric of each community built after the 2020 housing investment boom.    
 
By overlaying publicly sourced City of Calgary community outlines data onto my basemap in ArcGIS Online I was able to apply a colour gradient to the community boundaries, derived from the community age data that I had previously acquired through my research and data mining efforts. This community age data presents itself as a colour gradient, specifically colouring each community/community segment that was established in 2020 or after. On this resulting map I overlayed my mathematical chart which contains the number of homes in each of the 19 communities created after 2020, their respective tree canopy scores, UHI scores, and a detailed breakdown of how the scoring table was created. I wanted a 1-10 scale which I found by autosum-Max., Min., Average. And establishing pre prescribed value jumps between each of the 1-10 levels. This resulting scoring system highlights the relationship between tree canopy and UHI.
